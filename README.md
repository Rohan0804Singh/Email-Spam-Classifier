# ðŸ“¨ Email Spam Classifier

A lightweight **machine learning API** built using **FastAPI** that detects spam messages based on natural language processing and a trained classification model.

This project demonstrates how to serve an ML model using FastAPI and includes custom text preprocessing using **NLTK**.

## ðŸ§  Model Overview

- Model trained on a dataset of SMS messages labeled as "spam" or "ham"
- Preprocessing steps include:
  - Lowercasing
  - Removing punctuation and stopwords
  - Stemming using `PorterStemmer`
- Vectorization via `CountVectorizer` or `TfidfVectorizer`
- Model saved using `joblib`
